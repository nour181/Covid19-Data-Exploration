# Covid19-Data-Exploration

Hi

Here I started to explore data with some questions that would give me knowledge about Covid19

Data contains two tables:
1) coviddeath data        2) covidvaccination data


first: I have started with deleting some rows that were in the wrong column(delete noncountries from the location column)

** Location = Country

second: I made some questions to understand more about countries situation with Covid19

* Number of cases in every country till now

* Show me specific country with total number of cases(stored procedure)

* follow the development of cases from beginning till now in specific country(stored procedure)

* Number of deaths in Each Country 

* Percentage of Dying in each country from total cases

* Percentage of Dying in each country from total cases in specific country(stored procedure)

* the 10 highest countries in Covid Cases

* the 10 highest countries in Deaths

*  Total Vaccination in each country

* Percentage of people vacinated from total population of each country

* median age for people vaccinated for each country



Thanks for reading my code, Please give me your feedback and instructions to improve and make me better with SQL
